After this first drawing you write down your guess of the probabilty of the selected urn being urn A. \n\n| drawing | W | R | probability of being urn A (%) |\n| :-----: | :-: | :-: | :-------------------------: |\n| 1st |  2 | 1  | ? |\n\nThe person will continue drawing balls from the urn and you will alter your probabilty based on the colour of the balls drawn.\n\n## Indicative and deontic reasoning\nOur logic is not always rational. As humans we're much better at deontic reasoning than indicative reasoning.\n\n### Indicative reasoning\n= Pure logic/abstract reasoning =\u003e true/false\n\nExercise to illustrate:\n\n4  cards with a letter on one side and a number on the other:\n| A | B | 4 | 7 |\n| - | - | - | - |\n\nRULE: if it's a vowel, it should always have an even number on the other side\n=\u003e which card(s) do you turn to test the rule?\n\n### Deontic Reasoning\n= Reasoning about permissions, obligations, prohibitions =\u003e social rules\n\nExercise to illustrate:\n\n4 cards with an age on one side and a drink on the other: \n\n| 17 | 25 | coke | beer |\n| -- | -- | ---- | ---- |\n\nRULE: if you're under 18, you can't drink alcohol\n=\u003e which card(s) do you turn to test the rule?\n\n\u003eThe first exercise (letter \u0026 numbers) is a lot harder than the second one (age \u0026 drinks), although the logic is the same. That's because humans are very good at social reasoning. This is linked with dominance theory and theory of mind.\n\n#### Dominance theory\nThe size of the social group of an animal is linked with the brain size (size of the frontal cortex in relation to the rest of the brain) of that animal ==\u003e you need a lot of brain capacity to keep track of all the social relations. \n\nHumans have the biggest brain size ratio and can have social groups of 100 to 150 individuals. This social group has a social hierarchy. If you're dominant, you need social skills to define the rules and make others follow them. If you're non-dominant, you use your social skills to mitigate those rules, form alliances, .... Most people are both dominant and non-domninant depending on the context.\n\n#### Theory of mind\nThis is the capacity to represent \u0026 manipulate the internal representations in the mind of others (= recognize and predict others thougths)\n\n### Tips\nIt's easier for humans to use logic when there is:\n1. a social contract (f. ex. \"spot the cheater\")\n2. a concrete example (a situation we can imagine)\n\nTips to increase our logic reasoning:\n- think through, write down\n- use concrete/meaningful examples\n- ...\n\n## Functional fixedness (einstellung)\nA risk of having experience in certain tasks is that, once we spotted a pattern, we keep using it and we miss other options/solutions. Once someone has presented us a solution, our mind gets stuck on it and we stop trying to find other (easier) solutions.\n\nAdvantages to thinking in patterns:\n- speed \n- standardization\n- reduced cognitive load\n- reduced uncertainty\n\nWays of avoiding this while testing:\n- be aware of einstellung\n- get multiple perspectives, discuss with others, do pair testing\n- limit/challenge yourself to trigger creativity, f.ex. obligate yourself to find at least 2 different solutions\n- swap subject/context\n- change the order of test execution\n\nExercise to illustrate:\n- measure a desired volume of water with 3 jars\n\n## There's more information than we know\nSometimes a test/experiment yields more information than we realise, a test can give us both information about what we test and what we don't test. We should be creative in finding solutions to testing problems.\n\nExercise to illustrate:\n\u003e 12 weights problem: you have a scale and 12 similar objects of which 11 have the exact same weight and 1 is either heavier or lighter (this is unknown). You have to identify the object with the different weight and know if it's lighter or heavier in the least possible weighings. \n\nSpending a lot of time to find the most elegant/ideal solution to test something (f. ex. in the least amount of steps) might be too time consuming. If we can get the same result faster via brute force, this might be preferred, especially when the cost of running a test is low. When we have only 1 chance to run a test, or the cost or consequences of running the test are high, the most elegant solution might be better.\n\nHow can we generate other solutions?\n- brainstorming\n- assert/inform that a solution exist =\u003e f. ex. by knowing that there is a way to solve the 12 weights problem in 3 steps, you will try to find that solution\n\n## Summary\n![[_attachments/Pasted image 20220607205851.png]]\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-07-12T07:26:00.883132711Z","tags":null},"/conferences/Eurostar-2022-Copenhagen-Denmark-seen-by-me-Manu":{"title":"Eurostar 2022 Copenhagen Denmark seen by me, Manu","content":"[[people/Manu/Emmanuel]]\n\n# Eurostar 2022 Copenhagen Denmark seen by me, Manu\n\n**_EuroSTAR_** _stands for_ **_Euro_**_pean_ **_S_**_oftware_ **_T_**_esting_ **_A_**_nalysis \u0026_ **_R_**_eview._\n\nHi !,\n\nWhat the heck would a “data guy” from the BI-team, go to a Software Testing Conference!? \n\nPs: I was accompanied by 4 Sfpd, “strangers” to me at first, but 4 days living together changed that!

We are vulnerable to **Cognitive Biases** and **Thinking Traps** that can catch out even the most seasoned person.\n\nOne of the most common thinking traps we face is that we tend to think in ways that confirm our existing beliefs, rather than challenging those beliefs.\n\nAnother thinking trap is that we often spend too much time collecting additional data about a problem, when we would be better off using that time to generate alternate theories about the problem’s cause.\n\nWe are vulnerable to EINSTELLUNG, or functional fixedness, where our minds solve problems using fixed patterns.\n\nEinstellung is the development of a mechanised state of mind. Often called a problem solving set, Einstellung refers to a person's predisposition to solve a given problem in a specific manner even though better or more appropriate methods of solving the problem exist. [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstellung_effect)\n\nInteresting Lectures / Videos:\n-   [wiki: Confirmation bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias)\n-   [http: What is a cognitive bias](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-a-cognitive-bias-2794963) \n-   **[video:The Most Common Cognitive Bias](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKA4w2O61Xo)**\n-   [video: Confirmation bias is a tendency to look for, interpret, and recall information in ways that affirm our preconception. Whenever we encounter objective facts on an issue we look at them through the lens of our own beliefs. As a result, we see and overrate where the two intercept. The bias is strongest for emotionally charged issues or when we search for desired outcomes. This joke illustrates it quite well...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kho5KvPBDSw) \n-   [video: The Confirmation Bias](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kho5KvPBDSw)\n- ...google it 😇\n\n## Get out of your role...\nTester should get out of their “tester only” role, try to put your nose to your neighbors roles.\nYou should not find a way to go faster you should do it better.\nCustomer is always right =\u003e no =\u003e feedback of all intervenants … and yourself.\nJust make things go smoother to take away these boring tasks to keep your mental health sanely.\nAgile … ok, soft boundaries are needed no free all no constraints chaos.\nPut in cv: Not certified in …. And put your list 😇\n\n## Drawing for Effective Testing\n“A picture speaks 1000 words” to quote a proverb. I rephrase this to “A drawing replaces 100 (textual) user stories”.\nWhen generating tests it is sometimes better to focus on negative tests i.e., verifying the \"not\" designs rules (what the system is not expected to do) rather than positive tests i.e. verifying the predifined design rules.\nGraphical representations help identifying tests which is difficult to extract from (textual) user stories, especially negative test cases also known as \"Error Path Testing\" or \"Failure Testing\". These tests are generally harder to set up and a graph representation of the application rules helps this setup.\n\n## The 7Ps rule\n\"**P**roper **P**lanning \u0026 **P**reparation, **P**revents **P**… **P**oor **P**erformance\"\n\n![[7ps A well-known fact.jpeg]]\n\nWhat happens before a backlog is created, and how we can make sure to validate the solution upfront, for instance, by using pretotyping, personas, RAT (Riskiest Assumption Testing), Design Sprints and much more, before we start building it.\n“Seven Ps aren’t just useful for the big things: they are useful in everyday operations and can make your job much easier.\nAs is, many companies don’t validate the solution upfront; they don’t know if it’s the right product for the right people, and they are too busy delivering to make sure what they do is the right thing.\n\n- **Prototyping**, testers should be included early in the loop, they can help finding out they it is what end users and stakeholders wants…\n- **Protoplanning** , very early everybody needs to know what will be the deliverable and all participants in the loop should be involved!!! \n  Testers can come with valuable input in the beginning of a project and help prepare a good plan.\n- **Early collaboration** , in an agile organisation this should not be a problem\n\n[The 7 Ps is a British Army adage for **Proper Planning and Preparation Prevents Piss Poor Performance**.

The problem is: language is not universal,. Even when people speak the same language, the communication can be confusing.\n\n_Example_: Repeated phrases or redudant words in some laguages that are added for flavor or to add personnality to a message.\n\n#### Language shapes your view of reality\n_The case of the color Blue_\nHistorians have noticed that in some ancient cultures, there was no mention of the color \"blue\", no equivalent word. \nSome anthropologists thought that maybe, humans developed the ability to see blue more recently. However, it seems they just didn't separate _blue_ from other colors as a concept. The greeks for example, would describe the sea as \"_dark wine_\" and not blue.\n\nHowever, a recent experiment on some namibian tribes that don't have a word for _blue_ showed something even more interresting.  \nIn an experiment showing a bunch of green squares and a single blue square, they were enable to spot the blue one.\nIt seems that the fact that they don't have the concept of blue prevents them from distinguishing blue, even if they're physicly capable of it. On the other side, they're capable of seeing subtle shades of green that westerners can't.\n\nThis highlights how much one's history, language, habit, culture can heavily alter how they interpret a message, een as basic as a color.\n\n#### Language with no words\n\nGestures and sounds are the origin or language. Sounds used in the language were once sufficient to transmit information, before they were articulated into words.\n\n**Most common word** : Huh ?\nUnderstood in most cultures.\n\n#### Choosing the most common words\n\nIn order to be the most easily understood, try to use the most common words you can. It will allow people with less context knowledge to easily understand what you mean.\n\n### Symbols\n\nSome symbols, like the heart, are preaty much universal \nThe heart symbol comes from the Fig !\n![[_attachments/Pasted image 20220607144741.png]]\nThat fruit is considered holy in some religions and has played an important role in old cultures.\n\nSome other symbols are old, but had a recent history that changed their meaning. ex : the swatzika\n\n#### Hidden complexity in symbols\nSome symbols only work in a context, it's better to have symbols that are explicit.\n\nThe symbol should be positive.\n\nEnd of zone 30 km/H : doesn't tell you what speed you can now ride at. You have to know the context to interpret it correctly.\n\n## How to simplify Communication in tests ?\n\nWe should always be careful of the comunication we emit, and try to work on that communication to make it simple to the person it's destined to, without hiding things.\n\nQuestions to ask yourself\n- Who do we communicate to ?\n\t- Cultural difference ?\n- Are those acronyms necessary ? \n\t- are they widely understood ?\n\t- are they context dependent ?\n- Focus on the information that brings value to the people receiving it.\n- Focus on common simple words\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-07-12T07:26:00.883132711Z","tags":null},"/conferences/test-design-debt-Renaud":{"title":"What's your Test Design Debt ?
