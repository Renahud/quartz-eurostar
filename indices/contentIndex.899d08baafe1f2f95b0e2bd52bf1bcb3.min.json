Teams need specialised testers, because they have a different mindset.\n\nDevelopers tend to focus on unit tests and miss the top of the pyramid. Which require more business knowledge.\n\nEnd to end can be multi-aplication, but also in a single application.\n\nThe tester should have the most knowledge about functionalities of the system, they are needed to free time from developers.\n\n## Approaches to test automation\n\n### 3 amigos approache\n- [PO](Product%20Owner.md)\n- Tester\n- Developper\nAll working together.\n\n### Behavior driven development\n\n**Given -when -then** syntax used to describe a behavior.\nBridre between manual test and automated test.\n\n### Keyword driven Testing\nolder apporach.\nAction words + parameters\nThe developers must create a framework/library to execute the keywords.\nNice idea, but this approach still stems from code and development. Thus still usually developper-driven.\n\n### Model-based Testing\n\nWorkflows + business rules.\n\n### Visual acceptence test driven development\n\nBest of everything, the goal of this tuto.\n\n- Test-friven like BDD\n- Vidial with MBT\n- Colaboration of 3 amigos\n- Separate logic and code using keywords.\n\n# Tutorial\n\n## Business Wrkflows to visualization\n\nProgram to test : [Car insurance simulation](https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdemo-simulator.herokuapp.com%2F\u0026data=05%7C01%7Crenaud.pirson%40sfpd.fgov.be%7C714366dbeafb43409be208da4490f877%7C66c008a4b56549a993c9c1e64cad2e11%7C0%7C0%7C637897686686314826%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C\u0026sdata=xQzUXQDDltuNcoyZpnXcySON9rppRoKpXjZFhbQl%2Brk%3D\u0026reserved=0).\n\nTests focused on the business flow. \n\nWorkflow as modeled in Yest :\n\n![[_attachments/Pasted image 20220607100248.png]]\n\n\nThe discussion should stay at a high level.

Yet, we often fail to train ourselves in the most important testing skill of all– how to think critically about what we are testing. Also, when we test, we are vulnerable to cognitive biases and thinking traps that can catch out even the most seasoned tester.\n\nIn this workshop, I share a training course I developed in our organisation, aimed at helping both new and experienced testers develop their critical thinking skills, as well as help address our biases and thinking traps.\n\nOne of the most common thinking traps we face is that we tend to think in ways that confirm our existing beliefs, rather than challenging those beliefs. Hence, we begin our tutorial with an exercise to reveal our vulnerability to this bias, then show how we can mitigate our vulnerability.\n\nAnother thinking trap is that we often spend too much time collecting additional data about a problem, when we would be better off using that time to generate alternate theories about the problem’s cause. In our next exercise, we diagnose a problem by either collecting additional data or generating alternate theories. We discover that generating alternate theories is more effective.\n\nA further trap is that we create tests that are non-diagnostic, in that their results do not tell us anything new. We use an experiment of selecting different coloured balls from a bag to explore how we create tests that have no diagnostic value, or reach conclusions based on non-diagnostic data.\n\nIn another exercise, we explore how our reasoning does not use logic, or at least not rational logic, but rather we use logic based upon social permissions and cheater detection. We use this to explore how to write better tests by rephrasing testing requirements in terms of social logic.\n\nNext, we splash around with some water to explore how we are vulnerable to EINSTELLUNG, or functional fixedness, where our minds solve problems using fixed patterns.\n\nFinally, we explore a problem with 12 weights, to reveal just how much unknown, hidden information may be available within test results.\n\nCome along to this session and learn how you can improve your testing by enhancing your critical thinking skills.\n\nSummary\n![[_attachments/Pasted image 20220607205851.png]]","lastmodified":"2022-06-08T07:43:06.272309439Z","tags":null},"/people/Jana":{"title":"Jana","content":"\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-06-08T07:43:06.272309439Z","tags":null},"/people/Manon":{"title":"Manon","content":"\n\u003e  _“Experience is the name everyone gives to their mistakes.” – Oscar Wilde_\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1592113/embed/?plusEmbedHash=YmVhMjY2ZWQxYjk5NzY4NWU2YWYyYzg3Mjk4NGViNTBkNWU5MjUzNTc1NjRkODZmZTQzMzNlNDk2ODNhZGEwNDk3MTQ5YzYzZGY4ZGFkZDMzZWYzNzVlZDBlZThlZTU0MmMxNGE2OTllNGVjYmNhNTA3NzE5ZjIzMmE1ZWQzZjZ6OEVkZ1JxY2NPd2VBSXNlRk1HMVZYckpyRkFjMnNhR2pONEFDZ1g0ZmdnbDBxVGxFTFFqblFwU01QbnlOQTZKd2k0MGxwMmUxYzZEcXBxMFBiR0lsUT09\u0026plusEmbedTitle=true\" width=\"700\" height=\"600\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e","lastmodified":"2022-06-08T07:43:06.272309439Z","tags":null},"/people/Renaud":{"title":"Renaud","content":"\nHi, I'm a 34 years old java developer.
