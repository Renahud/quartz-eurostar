Teams need specialised testers, because they have a different mindset.\n\nDevelopers tend to focus on unit tests and miss the top of the pyramid. Which require more business knowledge.\n\nEnd to end can be multi-aplication, but also in a single application.\n\nThe tester should have the most knowledge about functionalities of the system, they are needed to free time from developers.\n\n## Approaches to test automation\n\n### 3 amigos approache\n- PO\n- Tester\n- Developper\nAll working together.\n\n### Behavior driven development\n\n**Given -when -then** syntax used to describe a behavior.\nBridre between manual test and automated test.\n\n### Keyword driven Testing\nolder apporach.\nAction words + parameters\nThe developers must create a framework/library to execute the keywords.\nNice idea, but this approach still stems from code and development. Thus still usually developper-driven.\n\n### Model-based Testing\n\nWorkflows + business rules.\n\n### Visual acceptence test driven development\n\nBest of everything, the goal of this tuto.\n\n- Test-friven like BDD\n- Vidial with MBT\n- Colaboration of 3 amigos\n- Separate logic and code using keywords.\n\n# Tutorial\n\n## Business Wrkflows to visualisation\n\nProgram to test : [Car insurance simulation](https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdemo-simulator.herokuapp.com%2F\u0026data=05%7C01%7Crenaud.pirson%40sfpd.fgov.be%7C714366dbeafb43409be208da4490f877%7C66c008a4b56549a993c9c1e64cad2e11%7C0%7C0%7C637897686686314826%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C\u0026sdata=xQzUXQDDltuNcoyZpnXcySON9rppRoKpXjZFhbQl%2Brk%3D\u0026reserved=0).\n\nTests focused on the business flow. \n\nWorkflow as modeled in Yest :\n\n![](Pasted%20image%2020220607100248.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Automated tests Generation\n\n\n\n---\n## Creation of automated Tests\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-06-07T08:10:43.877511495Z","tags":null},"/Tutorial-I":{"title":"Tutorial  I","content":"\nNotes by [Renaud](people/Renaud.md), [Manon](people/Manon.md)\n\n## Simplicity: Distilling and Refining Test Communication\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-06-07T08:10:43.877511495Z","tags":null},"/Wednesday-08-06-2022":{"title":"Wednesday 08-06-2022","content":"\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-06-07T08:10:43.877511495Z","tags":null},"/people/Emmanuel":{"title":"Emmanuel","content":"\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-06-07T08:10:43.877511495Z","tags":null},"/people/Jana":{"title":"Jana","content":"\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-06-07T08:10:43.877511495Z","tags":null},"/people/Manon":{"title":"Manon","content":"\n\u003e  _“Experience is the name everyone gives to their mistakes.” – Oscar Wilde_\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-06-07T08:10:43.877511495Z","tags":null},"/people/Renaud":{"title":"Renaud","content":"\nHi, I'm a 34 years old java developer.
