Create/ give me your github account OR a public ssh key you want to commit with. I need to give you the rights to push.\n2. clone the [repository](https://github.com/Renahud/quartz-eurostar) somewhere on your disk\n3. You can now edit the files in the content subfolder. I recommend usine Osidian to do that, but you can edit with any software you want, as long as you save in the markdown format.\n\n## Publishing the notes\nWhen you are done editing, there's only one thing left to do to publish your notes: you have to push to the gitHub repository.\n\n\u003e [!caution] Do not push to the **master**\n\u003e You need to push to the **hugo** branch.\n\u003e The master branch contains the site that is generated by the Github workflow.\n\nOnce your change are pushed to the **hugo** branch, the site will be automatically updated. Isn't it nice ?\n\n## Obsidian\n\n1. Install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)\n\t1. Open Obsidian \n\t2.

Teams need specialised testers, because they have a different mindset.\n\nDevelopers tend to focus on unit tests and miss the top of the pyramid. Which require more business knowledge.\n\nEnd to end can be multi-aplication, but also in a single application.\n\nThe tester should have the most knowledge about functionalities of the system, they are needed to free time from developers.\n\n## Approaches to test automation\n\n### 3 amigos approache\n- [PO](Product%20Owner.md)\n- Tester\n- Developper\nAll working together.\n\n### Behavior driven development\n\n**Given -when -then** syntax used to describe a behavior.\nBridre between manual test and automated test.\n\n### Keyword driven Testing\nolder apporach.\nAction words + parameters\nThe developers must create a framework/library to execute the keywords.\nNice idea, but this approach still stems from code and development. Thus still usually developper-driven.\n\n### Model-based Testing\n\nWorkflows + business rules.\n\n### Visual acceptence test driven development\n\nBest of everything, the goal of this tuto.\n\n- Test-friven like BDD\n- Vidial with MBT\n- Colaboration of 3 amigos\n- Separate logic and code using keywords.\n\n# Tutorial\n\n## Business Wrkflows to visualization\n\nProgram to test : [Car insurance simulation](https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdemo-simulator.herokuapp.com%2F\u0026data=05%7C01%7Crenaud.pirson%40sfpd.fgov.be%7C714366dbeafb43409be208da4490f877%7C66c008a4b56549a993c9c1e64cad2e11%7C0%7C0%7C637897686686314826%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C\u0026sdata=xQzUXQDDltuNcoyZpnXcySON9rppRoKpXjZFhbQl%2Brk%3D\u0026reserved=0).\n\nTests focused on the business flow. \n\nWorkflow as modeled in Yest :\n\n![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220607100248.png)\n\n\nThe discussion should stay at a high level.
