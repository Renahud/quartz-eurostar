## What is simplification ?

What is simpler  is easier to take in.
There's value in simplicity itself.

Tometimes, what looks simpler is not actually more simple.
Simplifying =/= hiding the mess.

## Language

Tool of expression and identity.
Everyone uses it, not always the same way.

### the case of the color "blue"
 A lot of ancient cultures didn't have a concept of blue.
 The greeks would describe it as "deep wine".
 Maybe they could see it., maybe not.
 It could also be that without the concept, they can't discen the difference.
