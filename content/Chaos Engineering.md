title: "Chaos Engineering"
---

>Chaos engineering is the discipline of experimenting on a software system in production in order to build confidence in the system's capability to withstand turbulent and unexpected conditions 
/ _Wikipedia_

But i prefer this speaker's definition :

> A systematic approach to pushing a system environment outside its comfort zone in order to learn about the system(s) under test and discover potential problems before they become actual problems.
/_Richard Rostad_

Which dosn't imply the need to test those things in production.
