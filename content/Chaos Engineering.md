title: "Chaos Engineering"

>Chaos engineering is the discipline of experimenting on a software system in production in order to build confidence in the system's capability to withstand turbulent and unexpected conditions 
\Wikipedia

But i prefer this speaker's definition :

> A systematic approach to pushing a system environment outside its comfort zone in order to learn about the system(s) under test and discover potential problems before they become actual problems.
\Richard Rostad

Which dosn't imply the need to test those things in production.
