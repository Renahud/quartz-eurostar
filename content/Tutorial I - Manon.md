## Simplification

**It doesn't need to just *look* simpler but to actually be simpler.**

There is value in simplicity : 
- Ease
- Goal transparency

> Sometimes when we "simplify" things, we're just making the mess invisible.

**LOOKING SIMPLE != BEING SIMPLE**

#### Identity and expression

Language is a tool of expression ; everyone has it.

- Are you communicating.... something


### Puzzles vs Mysteries

#### Puzzles

***Referential knowledge***. You put together what you have/know, and figure out what's missing, what you don't have.

--> The information here is a close system. Everything you need is there

#### Mysteries

A lot of information. Any information you can get. You have to move information away, find out what the important information is. 

--> Too much information
