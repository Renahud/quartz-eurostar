## Simplicity: Distilling and Refining Test Communication


What is simpler  is easier to take in.
There's value in simplicity itself.

Tometimes, what looks simpler is not actually more simple.
Simplifying != hiding the mess.

### Language
Test communication relies mostly on languange. The problem is: language is not universal,. Even when people speak the same language, the communication can be confusing.

_Example_: Repeated phrases or redudant words in some laguages that are added for flavor or to add personnality to a message.

#### Language shapes your view of reality
_The case of the color Blue_
Historians have noticed that in some ancient cultures, there was no mention of the color "blue", no equivalent word. 
Some anthropologists thought that maybe, humans developed the ability to see blue more recently. However, it seems they just didn't separate _blue_ from other colors as a concept. The greeks for example, would describe the sea as "_dark wine_" and not blue.

However, a recent experiment on some namibian tribes that don't have a word for _blue_ showed something even more interresting.
