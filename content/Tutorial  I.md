## Simplicity: Distilling and Refining Test Communication


### Simplification

**It doesn't need to just *look* simpler but to actually be simpler.**

There is value in simplicity : 
- Ease
- Goal transparency

> Sometimes when we "simplify" things, we're just making the mess invisible.

**LOOKING SIMPLE != BEING SIMPLE**

### Language
Test communication relies mostly on languange. The problem is: language is not universal,. Even when people speak the same language, the communication can be confusing.

_Example_: Repeated phrases or redudant words in some laguages that are added for flavor or to add personnality to a message.

#### Language shapes your view of reality
_The case of the color Blue_
Historians have noticed that in some ancient cultures, there was no mention of the color "blue", no equivalent word. 
Some anthropologists thought that maybe, humans developed the ability to see blue more recently. However, it seems they just didn't separate _blue_ from other colors as a concept. The greeks for example, would describe the sea as "_dark wine_" and not blue.

However, a recent experiment on some namibian tribes that don't have a word for _blue_ showed something even more interresting.  
In an experiment showing a bunch of green squares and a single blue square, they were enable to spot the blue one.
It seems that the fact that they don't have the concept of blue prevents them from distinguishing blue, even if they're physicly capable of it. On the other side, they're capable of seeing subtle shades of green that westerners can't.

This highlights how much one's history, language, habit, culture can heavily alter how they interpret a message, een as basic as a color.

#### Language with no words

Gestures and sounds are the origin or language. Sounds used in the language were once sufficient to transmit information, before they were articulated into words.

**Most common word** : Huh ?
Understood in most cultures.

#### Choosing the most common words

In order to be the most easily understood, try to use the most common words you can. It will allow people with less context knowledge to easily understand what you mean.

### Symbols

Some symbols, like the heart, are preaty much universal 
The heart symbol comes from the Fig !

That fruit is considered holy in some religions and has played an important role in old cultures.

Some other symbols are old, but had a recent history that changed their meaning. ex : the swatzika

#### Hidden complexity in symbols
Some symbols only work in a context, it's better to have symbols that are explicit.

The symbol should be positive.

End of zone 30 km/H : doesn't tell you what speed you can now ride at. You have to know the context to interpret it correctly.

## How to simplify Communication in tests ?

We should always be careful of the comunication we emit, and try to work on that communication to make it simple to the person it's destined to, without hiding things.

Questions to ask yourself
- Who do we communicate to ?
	- Cultural difference ?
- Are those acronyms necessary ? 
	- are they widely understood ?
	- are they context dependent ?
- Focus on the information that brings value to the people receiving it.
- Focus on common simple words
