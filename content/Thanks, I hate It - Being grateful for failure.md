title: "Thanks, I hate It: Being grateful for failure - Dylan Lacey"

Failure is ...
- inevitable: it's the first step in doing anything complex.
- valuable: it teaches something about the system under your control. More failures => more defects found => better system

Extracting signals and value from failure: context dependent

You need
- emotional prerequisites: pshychological safety, responsibility and control
- environmental prerequisites: stable environments, learning culture, ...
- know-how: 

Not
- Brainstorming: leads to normalizing to the most obvious/sensible ideas, reduces creativity
- blame

Approach to failure in a learning culture:
failure tolerance <> no consequences
failure differentation => psychological safety (you look at the origin of the failure, the intention)

Use failures in different stages (build, integration tests, deploy, production) as a chance to adapt your approach, processes, rules, environments, ... => LEARNING
