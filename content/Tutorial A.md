##  [[shaping testing]] – A Simulation in Scrum
1) get experience with splitting stories and epics together with the team (backlog refinement session) : try to create smaller stories
2) get experience with raising risks (probabiblity x impact) with the team (backlog refinement session)
3) perform estimates with the team as a whole (backlog refinement session)
4) collaborating on the test approach within the team: defining tests levels together with the whole team
5) Identify & plan the tasks (inclusive testing tasks) during sprint planning for the stories of the sprint : per story level : lists things to be done (not by whom - help will be provide where needed)

How to avoid shift to next sprint : try to create smaller stories + test design asap in the process 

=> the purpose of all that sprint workflow : raise the discussion as a team to get a common understanding of quality
