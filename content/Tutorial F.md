# Introduction

### Visualising Busines Workflows

Also known as **Model Based testing**.

---

We want to Atomalte Tests, but it is difficult.

In agile teams, there's often no dedicated testers.

ISTQB was born from the constat thet it doesn't work. Teams need specialised testers, because they have a different mindset.

Developers tend to focus on unit tests and miss the top of the pyramid. Which require more business knowledge.

End to end can be multi-aplication, but also in a single application.

The tester should have the most knowledge about functionalities of the system, they are needed to free time from developers.

## Approaches to test automation

### 3 amigos approache
- PO
- Tester
- Developper
All working together.

### Behavior driven development

**Given -when -then** syntax used to describe a behavior.
Bridre between manual test and automated test.

### Keyword driven Testing
older apporach.
Action words + parameters
The developers must create a framework/library to execute the keywords.
Nice idea, but this approach still stems from code and development. Thus still usually developper-driven.

### Model-based Testing

Workflows + business rules.

### Visual acceptence test driven development

Best of everything, the goal of this tuto.

- Test-friven like BDD
- Vidial with MBT
- Colaboration of 3 amigos
- Separate logic and code using keywords.
