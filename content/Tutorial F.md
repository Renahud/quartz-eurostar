We want to Atomalte Tests, but it is difficult.

In agile teams, there's often no dedicated testers.

ISTQB was born from the constat thet it doesn't work. Teams need specialised testers, because they have a different mindset.

Developers tend to focus on unit tests and miss the top of the pyramid. Which require more business knowledge.

End to end can be multi-aplication, but also in a single application.

The tester should have the most knowledge about functionalities of the system, they are needed to free time from developers.
