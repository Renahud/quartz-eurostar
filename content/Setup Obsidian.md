# Setup For Using the Blog

## Installation

1. Create/ give me your github account OR a public ssh key you want to commit with. I need to give you the rights to push.
2. clone the [repository](https://github.com/Renahud/quartz-eurostar) somewhere on your disk
3. You can now edit the files in the content subfolder. I recommend usine Osidian to do that, but you can edit with any software you want, as long as you save in the markdown format.

## Publishing the notes
When you are done editing, there's only one thing left to do to publish your notes: you have to push to the gitHub repository.

> [!ATTENTION] Do not push to the **master**
> You need to push to the **hugo** branch.
> The master branch contains the site that is generated by the Github workflow.

Once your change are pushed to the **hugo** branch, the site will be automatically updated. Isn't it nice ?
