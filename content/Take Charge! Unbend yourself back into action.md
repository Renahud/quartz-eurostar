[Official introduction](https://conference.eurostarsoftwaretesting.com/event/2022/take-charge-unbend-yourself-back-into-action/)

Mental healt issues have a lot of consequences, both on an individual level as at an organisational/society level.

What can we do?

As individuals:
- be aware of our mental health
- be mindful
- take time for ourselves
- take breaks and relax
- reach out and connect

As leaders:
- make yourself available for help
- LISTEN (<> hearing!)
- create a safe space (emotional & psychological)
- mentor and guide people
- build a culture of openness
- foster a culture of trust

==> chase trust & happiness instead of authority & profit
