## Problems

14 common reasons software projects fail (according to Forbes)
- not understanding the needs of the business
- lack of clarity and execution strategy
- not starting with end customer
- thinking that scaope can be defined upfront
- lack of coordination and detailed planning

The cost of fixing an issue goes up with time (from initiation phase to building phase to production) => the sooner you find it, the better.

## Right product

Quality doesn't matter if you're not building the right product.

You need to ask 2 questions:
- is it the right product (validation)? 
- is it built right (verification)?

"Doing the right thing is more important than doing the thing right" - Drucker

## Identify the right product
Testers can play an important role from the beginning - in the initiation phase, to identify if the product that will be developed is the right product.

Possible techniques: that can be used for proper planning and preparation:

### Kano analysis
Identify:
- performance factors: to be competitive
- basic factors: a working product
- exitement factors

### Pretotyping
- Prototype:
	- can we build it & how?
	- will it work as expected?
- Pretotype:
	- who would be interested in this?
	- will they use it as expected and continue to do so?

### Riskiest assumption testing
Test your riskiest assumption ("people want to use this product") before you start building it.
 
f. ex. AirBnb: they started by building a simple homepage and tested it by renting out their own living rooms. 

## Conclusion
