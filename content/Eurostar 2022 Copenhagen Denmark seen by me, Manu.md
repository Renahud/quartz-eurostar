# Eurostar 2022 Copenhagen Denmark seen by me, Manu


***EuroSTAR**** stands for ***Euro***pean ***S***oftware ***T***esting ***A***nalysis & ***R***eview.

Hi !,
What the heck would a “data guy” from the BI-team, go to a Software Testing Conference!?


Ps: I was accompanied by 4 Sfpd, “strangers” to me, but 4 days living together changed that! We rented a house at walk distance from the conference instead of having all our separate hotel room. https://abnb.me/Lbppe6yKNqb

I was a bit reluctant and skeptic but finally very pleased having had the privilege to assist at this wonderful community event.

I will try to share this excitement event by writing and drawing down some statements that I captured from the conference speakers that triggered my attention.
If you want, I am pleased to discuss these with you at any time.

## Day 1

### **Developing Critical Thinking Skills for (Testers, …)**
We are all skilled in our expertise domain 
but how do we to think critically about what and how we are doing our job. We are vulnerable to cognitive biases and thinking traps that can catch out even the most seasoned person.

One of the most common thinking traps we face is that we tend to think in ways that confirm our existing beliefs, rather than challenging those beliefs.

Another thinking trap is that we often spend too much time collecting additional data about a problem, when we would be better off using that time to generate alternate theories about the problem’s cause.

We are vulnerable to EINSTELLUNG, or functional fixedness, where our minds solve problems using fixed patterns.

Einstellung is the development of a mechanized state of mind. Often called a problem solving set, Einstellung refers to a person's predisposition to solve a given problem in a specific manner even though better or more appropriate methods of solving the problem exist. Wikipedia
