Hi, 

I am test lead and scrum master at Dagobah team. 
It's been two years within Covid period that I had the chance to follow the Eurostar Testing Conference online. This year, it is my first time conference on site in Copenhagen and I am really looking forward to see all the Eurostar speakers in live. 
This year again, as I was during my last participation, I am expecting to get inspired again for next year work at SFPD, and to have this chance to bring this experience back in my team and at SFPD.
