EuroSTAR stands for European Software Testing Analysis & Review.

Hi !,

What the heck would a “data guy” from the BI-team, go to a Software Testing Conference!?

Ps: I was accompanied by 4 Sfpd, “strangers” to me, but 4 days living together changed that! We rented a house at walk distance from the conference instead of having all our separate hotel room. https://abnb.me/Lbppe6yKNqb

Ps: whatever our role, we should try our best to be critical open minded observers and have the guts to act when our inner feelings push us to do so, which is the hardest part for me.
