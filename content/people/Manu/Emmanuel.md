# My BIO :

I am a curious, critical and positive minded person.

I have a furious need for sharing my thoughts, I love debating and asking lots of “why...” in the hope my interlocutors would learn me something new or helping me to get boiling unanswered questions out of my head…

Being aware that our brains are often biased, explains my ever questioning, so I let doubt prevail and seek for feedback to reassure myself not to be biases.

With my engineering background I like to dig and explore things in the hope to understand what’s behind it, I love to take things apart to discover the inners of the “machinery”.

From the beginning of my career (30 years already) I was confronted with data, lots of data, trying to organise it to my needs.

As we all know, the world around us has a natural tendency for chaos (entropy), so do Data!

DATA-ORGANIZING tasks gets more and more complex due to its never ending growing volumes of poorly structured data we capture every day, hour, sec., … (and copy and transform over and over again). It is important to be aware of this and find creative ways not to be overwhelmed by this phenomenon.

I will end this short intro of myself with this quote:

“creativity is our only weapon against entropy”
― Dean Cavanagh

Ps: whatever our role, we should try our best to be critical open minded observers and have the guts to act when our inner feelings push us to do so, which is the hardest part for me.
