## The Experiment

A remote ensemble testing session with the a whole cross-functional team (voluntarily)

Preparation steps:
1. find an interesting subject (piece of code)
2. prepare the session & yourself
3. create an experiment situation
4. have a discovery Tour
5. Use the right language (make it inviting)

Roles during session:
1. Driver
2. Navigator
3. Spectators

=> Switch regularly to keep people engaged

Afterwards:
get feedback from participants

## Expand to regular practice
### Ensemble
- truly diverse
- 8 different professions (roles) (f. ex. domain expert, dev, architect, tester, ...)
- the team that shows up is always the right one
- one safe (virtual) place for learning 

### Subject
How to work on the same thing at the same time? 
==> mission statement in test charter / based on questions

Planned session
- planned
- timebox
- wider audience
- mission driven
- test charter

Ad hoc session
- spontaneous
- variable in length
- smaller group
- question driven
- common goal

### Environment
In the same (virtual) space & on the same computer => works remote as well

## Impact
- software: module evaluations, part of approach, go live confidence
- culture: management buy-in, facilitate conversations, increased collaboration, mirroring sessions
- people: implicit learning, sharing knowledge, asking for more, uplevel relationships
