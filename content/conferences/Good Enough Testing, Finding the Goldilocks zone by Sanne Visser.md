# Good Enough Testing : Finding the Goldilocks zone
By *Sanne Visser*

Goldilocks = the habitable zone around a star where the temprature is just right - not too hot, not too cold - for liquid water to exsit on a planet.

This talk is about finding your "just fine" zone throughout 7 assessments we heard sometimes during our job...

## Testing is dead


## Build fast fail fast
Maybe slow down a bit and get better in quality. 

## Customer is always right

## Automate all the tests!
Too hot => Why is it asked? They think automate will make the project go faster...But in fact it takes time to automate. 
Too cold => Not using it to help you in you job in order to take the boring tasks away. 

## Bugs found early are cheap to fix

## Never Agile enough

## Thou shalt be certified
