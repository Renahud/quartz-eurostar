# Keynote : Lost in transformation
by _Michael Bolton_

Digital transformation

Most applications aren't designed for the cases where everithing is not going as planed. As soon as you have a special request, they break or lock you out.

Applications/ services aren't tested from the perspective of a user.
Most checks are done from the specs to see if the software is "_correct_". 
There is a lack of attention to the [[UX]] of the users / people who can have really bad consequences from a simple error.

**[[Reification]]** : turning people into objects.
Inside programs, people are reified.

A computer program is a [[medium]].

The medium is the message = what's important is how the medium transforms us.

 **So, How is digital transformation  transforming us ?**

Mediated testing (with tools/automation) can distord the perception of the user's experience of the product.

Other words for "_manual testing_" :

Manual testing can be a degrading qualification. Here are some alternative propositions:
- Experiential Testing
	- Can even be applied to testing an API, if you test it as if you were a developer using the API.
- Interractive testing
- Transformational testing

### Conclusion

=> **CONSIDER USING THE DAMNS THING**
