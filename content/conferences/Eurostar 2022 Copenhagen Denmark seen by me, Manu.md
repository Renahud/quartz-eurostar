# Eurostar 2022 Copenhagen Denmark seen by me, Manu

Hi !,

What the heck would a “data guy” from the BI-team, go to a Software Testing Conference!? 

Ps: I was accompanied by 4 Sfpd, “strangers” to me at first, but 4 days living together changed that! We rented a house at walk distance from the conference instead of having all our separate hotel room. [The house](https://abnb.me/Lbppe6yKNqb)

I was a bit reluctant and skeptic but finally very pleased having had the privilege to assist at this wonderful community event.

I will try to share this excitement event by writing and drawing down some statements that I captured from the conference speakers that triggered my attention.

If you want, I am pleased to discuss these with you at any time.

  
## Tut B - Developing Critical Thinking Skills for (Testers, …) (Andrew Brown)

We are all skilled in our expertise domain but how do we to think critically about what and how we are doing our job. We are vulnerable to **Cognitive Biases** and **Thinking Traps** that can catch out even the most seasoned person.

One of the most common thinking traps we face is that we tend to think in ways that confirm our existing beliefs, rather than challenging those beliefs.

Another thinking trap is that we often spend too much time collecting additional data about a problem, when we would be better off using that time to generate alternate theories about the problem’s cause.

We are vulnerable to EINSTELLUNG, or functional fixedness, where our minds solve problems using fixed patterns.

Einstellung is the development of a mechanised state of mind. Often called a problem solving set, Einstellung refers to a person's predisposition to solve a given problem in a specific manner even though better or more appropriate methods of solving the problem exist.

-   [video:Confirmation bias is a tendency to look for, interpret, and recall information in ways that affirm our preconception. Whenever we encounter objective facts on an issue we look at them through the lens of our own beliefs. As a result, we see and overrate where the two intercept. The bias is strongest for emotionally charged issues or when we search for desired outcomes. This joke illustrates it quite well...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kho5KvPBDSw)

## Get out of your role...
Tester should get out of their “tester only” role, try to put your nose to your neighbors roles.

You should not find a way to go faster you should do it better

Customer is always right => no => feedback of all intervenants … and yourself

Just make things go smoother to take away these boring tasks to keep your mental health sanely.

Agile … ok, soft boundaries are needed no free all no constraints chaos

Put in cv:

Not certified in …. And put your list 😇

Thank you
