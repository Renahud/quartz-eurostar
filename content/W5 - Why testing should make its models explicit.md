## What is a model?

A model is a representation of a system. By a critical thinker.

-- All the way the system reacts

Why make it explicit and drawing it down?

Models are often implicit, ambiguous and incomplete. 
- Stuck in people's heads
- In the internal logic of the tools, tests, files
- Buried in stories/docs

Formalising models can
- Automate test creation
- Maximise and target coverage
- Minimise test volumn and duplication
- Establish a central point of collaboration
- Automate maintenance in real-time

-> **Test continuously and rigorously based on change**

1. Reverse-engineer a model from assets.

? What a model entails : given an input and a output, all the ways to get from the input to the output ?
