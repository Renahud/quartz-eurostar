title: "Ready for Test â€“ A Symptom of a Poor Quality Culture"

[Official introduction](https://conference.eurostarsoftwaretesting.com/event/2022/ready-for-test-a-symptom-of-a-poor-quality-culture/)

Notes by [[people/Jana]]

### 3 ideas
- quality is everyone's responsability => not possible for 1 person
- everyone can test => everyone can ask questions
- you don't work on the space shuttle => be prepared to take calculated risks

### Problems
- sprint board: ready to test column is full of tickets
	- tasks get stuck (complex to test, too little time, too little testers)
	- only the tester is doing the testing
- sprint retro: "QA was a bottleneck"

### QA's don't own quality - Teams Do
- everyone on the team has a contribution to make 
- the earlier defects are caught the cheaper the fix 
	- don't start testing only after deployment
- separation on paper encourages separation in behaviour 
	- ready for test column distuingishes the testing from the rest of the work
	- no early testing
	- no shared quality ownership
	- ticket pingpong
	- lost understanding
	
### Removing "Ready for test" ?
When testing - think TOEs

Test 
- Together
- Often => shorter feedback loops
- Early

### Early Testing Strategies
#### Three amigos
-  test assumptions
-  discuss the task with a few people before working on it

#### Pairing
- test in real time
- work in pairs (f. ex. dev and analyst) to discover defects early and fix in real time
- one doing the work, other asking questions

#### Spike tickets
- test ideas
- timebox a task to test out a new idea within the team

Testing early negates "Ready for Test" => it's already tested

### Expertise - How to lead with ideas? 
- test high risk features => use in dept testing expertise
- discovery work => investigate pain points
- setup infrastructure/process
- advocate new testing techniques 
- provide examples of good testing

### Coaching - How do I promote testing?
- pair with team members => learn about colleagues work, ask questions
- review tests => use it as a teaching, coaching moment
- run team ceremonies => as facilitator, you can inject questions about testing (not too much)
- be present at learning sessions
- contribute to knowledge guides
- run workshops

### Foresight - How do I map a path to better testing?
- liaise with other teams => learn about strenghts, struggles
- review user feedback 
- find user feedback => gather information about quality
- attend meetups/conferences
- develop test roadmaps / strategy => help team members find priorities
- gap analysis => find what you're missing 

As QA you have more to offer your team than checking tickets.
