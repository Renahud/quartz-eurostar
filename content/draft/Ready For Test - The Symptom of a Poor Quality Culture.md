## Three ideas
- It's not possible for only testers on the team to own quality. Everyone needs to be involved.
- Everyone can test because testing is about asking questions and everyone can ask questions
- No one's gonna die if something go wrong. We can take some calculated risks, we can try things

## What is "Ready for test"?

A queue of work for testing.

### In practice

One QA in the team.

Jira columns: almost nothing in "Testing", a lot of things in the columns before including "Ready for test"

#### Sprint retrospective

**"QA was a bottleneck"**
***"Why am I the only one testing?"*** <- Right question to ask
-> "Because they're the QA, it's their job"

QA's don't own quality, the whole team does.
