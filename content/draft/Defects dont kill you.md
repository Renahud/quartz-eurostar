### The process

Using agile 

Embed test coverage on the jira
fields:
- coverage (end to end)
- ?

- dev start fix (need analysis)
- find coverage 
	- if not found plan to create
	- QA can create coverage if needed
- fix + coverage test are  merged

### Good Practices

- based on team capacity
- Create a coverage objective (%tage)
- Create a dashboard for followup/status
- Threshold
	- buffer of defects taht can exist at a moment
- Coverage fields in jira to categorize

### Yearly objective

- Setting a realistic target of coverage
- Find the impediments and address them ( capacity ?)
- Regular followup
- Iterate and improve regularly

### Dashboard

Description of a dashboard mockup

**role of scrum master to keep attention on it**

Charge the devs of refactoring to be able to cover with tests

### Continuous improvement
- motitor coverage status
- more test in dev
- adapt global objective
- monitor patterns
- sneak peek at backlog


> Most of us spend too much time on what is urgent and not enough time on what's important
/ Stephen R. Covey



## Notes

We should document all defects and try to cover them wih auto tests when possible. It will grow the coverage and help build a stronger application.

important to keep statistic of what breaks in prod and how often it breaks to help set priority.
