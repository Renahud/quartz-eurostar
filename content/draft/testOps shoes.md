## Put on your TestOps shoes
By _Dawid Pacia_

continuous build -> continuous validation -> continuous delivery -> continuous monitoring

TestOps:
- integration with [[Devops]] Infra
- which tests run and when
- No need to stad up the whole system to test

Problems :
- false positives
- false negatives
- flaky tests : the worst

More automation -> less control -> more risk

Golden questions : combinig Speed and quality
 => Quick Wins

Think about quality of the product, but also quality of the process, the environments, the tools.

Workflow :
- TO DO
- IN PROGRESS
- CODE REVIEW
- DEV READY
- QA READY
- QA IN PROGRESS
- DONE
