## The scene

Bank in Switzerland.
- Trading for clients
- Advice for clients
- Keeping books

Bunch of interfaces with surrounding interfaces


~ 60 to 80 people in IT
Divided in Agile teams of 6 to 10 people.
There was a separate test team 

Development was Agile, the separate test team was Waterfall

Feedbacks came back very late in the process

-> The idea : put testers into the team.
People were not happy. Skepticism.
There had been previous attempts but these testers were criticizing and blocking other members of the development team.

- Finding bugs easier at stages where it's cheaper to fix
- Fewer production incidents -> happier users
- Less risk

After introducing recruited (new) testers in the teams because thosse from the tester team were unwilling to join, they still didn't manage to make it work, mostly because the so-called test manager was reluctant. When he left for another project, they thought they could make it work, but it still didn't. In the end, what helped was the person who was simply *telling* them how to work to come work with them for real.


 **No framework or template can exactly match your own situation or project so you don't need to follow exactly what it says. Use what makes sense, what is useful, and leave the rest**

Â£We need allies, partners in crime, to get the whole team excited. *Change is a team effort*. 

Provide guidance but leave room for inddividual implementation.

Change needs time. There will be setbacks, patience is key.
