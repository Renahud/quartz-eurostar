# Mama said my shape was Okay

by _Jihad Ghandour_

3 main shapes of testers
- I
	- Knows a lot about 1 topic
- T
	- Knows a lot about 1 topic + knows a little about a lot of topics
	- seen as better than I
- X
	- Knows a lot about one topic
	- Is a string leader

## Concerns

- Bad requirements
	- ambiguous
= > same for the letters, descriptions are vague, hard to know where you fit

Only exist by comparison, they are relative.

counter example : **Tetris** => need all shapes (the I is the best one there)

Lack of context, do we need those skills ?

## Solution

Variable [[concepts/shaping testing|shape]].
Trying to fill a shape based on what is needed relative to other colleagues.
Encourage oter colleagues to adapt to you alseo.

## Collaboration

Do the "I" 's in the organisation had the opportunity to collaborate ? What would interrest them ?

What are we misssing ? 
- tools ?
- documentation ?
- knowledge
Ppeople will often adapt by themselves if they can identify what's missing.

### Impediments
- Tools
	- centralized version control (git)
	- automation server (jenkins)
	- **actively** encourage those who use the collaboration tools to contribute to it
- limiting beliefs
	- you cannot force someone to change, it comes from within
	- simplifying the challenge to ease the change, build confidence
	- advertise by honouring the people who collaborate
- Management
	- hard t oconvince
	- must show the real value of helping people to grow so that they want it
