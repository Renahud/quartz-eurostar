## The Nudge Theory

~ Economic theory / Using nudges as a way to guide a population

What they proposed is that there are two types of humans:

- **Humans**: flawed, don't have all the information or the capacity to use the information to make good economics decision
- **Economics humans**, have the capacity to use the information to make good economics decisions

Example: a lottery ticket with the % of gain chances at the back.

> Nudge theory is the theory of how can we make humans more economics humans

A nudge is basically a small thing that encourages someone to do something

### Different types of nudges
- Incentives
- Understand mappings
- Defaults
- Give feedback
- Expect error
- Structure complex choices

#### Understanding mappings
**Choices are hard**
-> Make information about the different options more understandable.

Sprint planning
-> "How long will it take you to test?"
--> Visualize it with Lego pieces: one color per type of team member (dev, tester, etc.) Each "bump" on a piece of logo represented a time unit. Everyone had a set of Lego pieces (thus time)

#### Defaults
**People are lazy**. We take the path of least resistence.
-> We need to make better defaults.

A lot of bugs coming in, hard to know which ones are the "big ones" to be addressed directly
-> Changed the default priority to Blocker for every bug.

#### Give feedback
**Tell people when they are doing well or when they are making mistakes**

- Auto-checks
- Any type of test

#### Expect error
**Humans make mistakes**
We need to expect it and be as forgiving as possible

When errors happen, get the most information out of it.

-> Crash-handling system that captures all the information of the system when it crashes.

#### Structure complex choices
**Hard to make a decision when the set of choices gets too large**
-> Need to simplify the choices, shrink the set

- Evaluate importance

#### Evaluate incentives
**It is what it says it is**
-> Influences

- People do what others do. -> (Good) peer pressure


## Summary

Nudges to get *quality enhanced* team members.
