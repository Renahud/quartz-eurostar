# Keynotes

## My essence of Testing
by *Richard Edgreen*

- Testing happens in head first
	- dependant of understanding

> [!quote] Essence of testing
> By understanding relations, you will among many things understand what is important, so you can do good testing (while also providing value in other way)

- Testing is a samplig business
	- never finished
	- your way of sampling is important
		- based on your understanding

## Relations
- Relations are important
	- between what you're testing and all other things it's dependant of / is interracting with

**Continuous learning**
-> learning to learn faster
Different ways to learn:
- experimenting
- discussing
- talking
- trying
- reading
- thinking
- writing
- teaching

Testers are also in relation with oter people.

Testing what's important != testing requirement != testing everything(impossible)
How to find what's important ?

>[!quote] Diverse Half-Measures 
>It's better to do more different kinds if testing to a pretty good level, than to do one or two kings of testing perfectly

## Serendipity
**Serendipity** : When looking for something, you found something else that is important and that you weren't looking for.

Making serendipity happen :
	- preparations
	- wide awareness
	- sagacity
	- understanding

## Models
- a way of simplifying on's understanding
- can come from multiple source
	- devs
	- data
	- usage
	- knowledge
	- a lot of other things...
- some models are not visible
- diversity is good (more views of the subject)

Modeling resource : [[SFDIPOT]]

## Binary desease
A lot of tools are binary : pass/fail
- pass/Fail addiction
	- need to put pass/fail on every test, bad feeling if you canot say either way
- Coverage Obsession
	- Obsessed with the percentage of coverage
- Metrics Tumour
- Sick Testing Techniques
	- too much equivalence partitionning (formalized)
	- thing of techniques first

A human's software
made by humans
for humans

Human can make better judgement about what's important.
