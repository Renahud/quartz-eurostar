## My essence of Testing
by *Richard Edgreen*

Testing starts in your head, it's dependant of your understanding of the problem the application is trying to solve.

Testing is a samplig business because it's never finished. You can never say you've tested everything. Therefore, your way of sampling is crucial in testing. On what base are you chosing what to test? The main source is your understanding.

## Relations

What are you trying to understand ? relations.
There are different types of relations:
- Within the system
- Between the system and other systems
- Between the system and it's users
- Between the people making the system (social relations)

**Therefore, you will be Continuous learning**
-> learning to learn faster
Different ways to learn:
- experimenting
- discussing
- talking
- trying
- reading
- thinking
- writing
- teaching

Testers are also in relation with oter people.

Testing what's important != testing requirement != testing everything(impossible)
How to find what's important ?

>It's better to do more different kinds if testing to a pretty good level, than to do one or two kings of testing perfectly

## Serendipity
**Serendipity** : When looking for something, you found something else that is important and that you weren't looking for.

Making serendipity happen :
	- preparations
	- wide awareness
	- sagacity
	- understanding

## Models
- a way of simplifying on's understanding
- can come from multiple source
	- devs
	- data
	- usage
	- knowledge
	- a lot of other things...
- some models are not visible
- diversity is good (more views of the subject)

Modeling resource : [[SFDIPOT]]

## Binary disease
A lot of tools are binary : pass/fail
- pass/Fail addiction
	- need to put pass/fail on every test, bad feeling if you canot say either way
- Coverage Obsession
	- Obsessed with the percentage of coverage
- Metrics Tumour
- Sick Testing Techniques
	- too much equivalence partitionning (formalized)
	- thing of techniques first

A human's software
made by humans
for humans

Human can make better judgement about what's important.
