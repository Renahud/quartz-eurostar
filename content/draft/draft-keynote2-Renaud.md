# Testing, Engineering, Tools & Futures
by *Paul Gerrard*

## Devops

Team of 7 people, maintaining 7 applications

**Continuous delivery, continuous discomfort**
... in 1984 ! Devops isn't new !

Life was simpler back then :
- fiewer technologies
- fewer libraries
- but more libraries to write yourself
- "complexity" per person was the same
- the "human" aspect was the same

*[[Devops]] is a human endeavour; not a technology.*

## Software, Testing and engineering

software development is not the same as engineering

Engineering :
- application of science & math 
- drawing boards
- machines:
	- calculators
	- big computers
	- floppy discs
- do
	- unerstand requirements
	- site survey
	- design, buildmodels
	- plan projects, bills of materials, people, schedules...
	- build stuff against those models to plan
	- plans, drawings, formulae...
- peer review
- measurements are core to the job
software:
- new
- doesn't obey laws of physics
- no reliable "law" to test against

Software engineer, is it really engineering ?
Computer science , is it a science ?

Not the same problems. We're not engineers, really.

Software design and testing are more about thoughts processes than about physics.

## Future Tools

### Using ML/AI to support testing

- We want to use them to "think" for us, do "intelligent" activities
- ml/ai activities must fit our ways of **thinking**

### New model of testing
see diagram in slides


### Testing styles, aproaches
Structured/waterfall vs exploratory testing (agile)

We should combine both aproaches, then AI/ML can help us.

Exploration Support
- tools that record what a tester does (acpture the exploration)
- tools that make suggestions for exploration ?

Surveying the work of the tester to generate a model of the system.

new Paradigm:
**Interactive Test Environment** (ITE) (ref to IDE)
- survey mode
- edit mode
- interactive test mode
- unattended mode

>Testing automation becomes a modeling problem, not a scripting/programming problem
