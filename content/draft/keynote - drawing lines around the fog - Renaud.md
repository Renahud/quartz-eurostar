# Keynote : Drawing lines around the fog
by _Alexandra Schladebeck_

or
 **7 Things I might be wrong about**

## Predictions

#### Quality will become even more important, and w'ell screw it up

 Machine learning biased
 Racist chatbots
 Problems with self-driving cars
 things are getting exponentially more complex and we might not be prepared to prenvent the worst of it
 The pressure will probably be too high for the testers to be able to hold their ground enough to correct the state of things
> "thnigs you do quickly are those that stay the longer"

#### Teams will have even more to do
New quality attributes :
- mental health
- sustainability
- ethics
- minimalism :
	- one of the agile principles, but forgotten
	- art of not doing things
	- decomplexification

What we do is **socio**-technical.

Even more roles and responsiblities for the teams
- data protection
- UX
- security
...

#### The [[concepts/shaping testing|shape]] of teams will have to change

We'll need specialists. Everybody won't be able to do it all.
We won't have the time to continuously train for every skills.
We still need to be carefull of silos.

Some of the new roles will be held by experts in a coaching role.

=> [[books/Team topologies]]

##### Comb shaped teams
Multiple specialities
-> getting better at learning how to learn

Devs not only develop
Testers do more than testing
What about UX ?  open question

Cameleons > chimeras

#### Exploration will be a crucial skill
Regroups a lot of different skills already.

But it won't be enough on it's own. Hard to integrate in teams with only that skills given all other skills needed, so people will need to expand in some dimentions.
Automation is not the only option though.

#### We need to understand friction

Friction : book:  [[The Art of Action]] (Stephen Bungay) #BookRef

Friction isn't avoidable.

#### Conflict training needs to be part of job training
Lots of conflicts in being a tester.
Biscuit driven development : BDD ;)

Common to human experience.
But conflicts impact quality.

Become better at solving conflicts:
- separate observation from interpretation
- accept other's feelings
- move forward to attack the problem, not each other

#### Filling these teams won't be easy

People change job quickly, hard to train and keep them.

### What can I do ?

- practic communication
- practise obsarvational skills
- conflict training
- Keep learning (comb shaping)
- Growth mindset
- Be more a chameleon than a chimera

### In teams
- share knowledge
- understand friction
- talk a bout risk and how to mitigate it 
- focus on value and minimal, sustainable solutions
- be willing to experiment in how to work together

**The uncertainty will be come more usual**
this might have been the case for very long for some other people.
