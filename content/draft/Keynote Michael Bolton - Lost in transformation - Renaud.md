# Keynote : Lost in transformation
by _Michael Bolton_

Digital transformation

Most applications aren't designed for the cases where everithing is not going as planed. As soon as you have a special request, they break or lock you out.

Applications/ services aren't tested from the perspective of a user.
Most checks are done from the specs to see if the software is "_correct_". 
There is a lack of attention to the UX of the users / people who can have really bad consequences from a simple error.

**Reification** : turning people into objects.
Inside programs, people are reified.

A computer program is a [[medium]].

The medium is the message = what's important is how the medium transforms us.

 => How is digital transformation  transforming us ?

Mediated testing (with tools/automation) can distord the perception of the user's experience of the product.

- **Experiential Testing**
	- Better word than manual testing, which can be degrading. Can even be applied to testing an API, if you test it as if you were a developer using the API.

- **Interractive testing**
- **Transformational testing**

=> **CONSIDER USING THE DAMNS THING**
