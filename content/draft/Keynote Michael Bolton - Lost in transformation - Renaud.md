# Keynote : Lost in transformation
by _Michael Bolton_

Digital transformation

Most applications aren't designed for the cases where everithing is not going as planed. As soon as you have a special request, they break or lock you out.

Applications/ services aren't tested from the perspective of a user.
Most checks are done from the specs to see if the software is "correct". 
Lack of attention to the UX of the users / people who can have really bad consequences from a simple error.

Reification : turning people into objects.
Inside programs, people are reified.

A computer program is a medium.
(Medium = technique chez Stiegler = rÃ©tention ternaire ?)

The medium is the message = what's important is how the medium transforms us.

 => How is digital transformation  transforming us ?
