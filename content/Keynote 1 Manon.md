> Conference theme: ***Shaping testing***

- Speaker: Rikard Egren

> If testing is easy, you are doing something wrong.

Testing happens in the head: it is people who decide what to test, what to report. Therefore, the understanding plays a huge role in the quality of the testing. We're not talking about understanding the application or the users, but the connection between the two.

> There is no universal essence of testing.

This is *his* essence of testing

1. Understand what is important 
2. Test it

It doesn't really mean much.

By understanding relations, you will understand what is important.

Value of testings -> communication of qualities, problems, risks and more.

> Testing is a sampling business, we are never finished

How the sampling is designed, executed, evaluated and reported can be decided by
- other people
- tradition
- something you read in a book / website
- ***your own understanding of this particular situation***


> No one can step in the same river twice, because it is not the same river and you're not the same person. Everything changes (Panta rei)

**Relations are important**

Example : a print button.
To test it, you need to understand the relation with the printer, the operating system, etc.

The relationship of the users with the software is what matters the most

### Continuous learning

You must know things to be able to test the product
Testing the product is learning about it.
By testing it, you will have new ideas about what to test
New perspectives -> value to the team -> chances to find important information


Learn how to be a fast learner
- Experimenting
- Discussing, talking, teaching
- Trying
- Reading, writing
- Thinking


### Testing is not an island

The relations we have with other people are also important to feel good and do good work.

The value of testing happens outside of testing

### Number one pragmatic testing advice

**Diverse half-measures**

> It is better to do more different kinds of testing to a pretty good level, than to do one or two kinds of testing perfectly

### Good testers are often lucky

***Serendipity*** : you find something you didn't know you were looking for.

- Preparations: increase chances of luck
- Wide awareness
- Sagacity - by knowing a lot about the software and its usage,  you can miake wise judgments about what happens and what more should be tested

By unterstanding differences and similarities -> know what to tests

### Models

A model is a version of someone's understanding. Hence, having multiple models is important. A model could come from 

- Developers
- Data
- Usage
- Knowledge of the product
- ...

### Modeling - Product elements

SFDIPOT

- Structure - what the product is
- Functions - what the product does
- Data - what the product operates on
- Interfaces - how the product can be accessed or expressed
- Platform - the environment the product depends on
- Operations - what the users want to accomplish
- Time - relations between the product and time

It's harder to evaluate the tests for the structure than the functions

### Binary disease

- Pass/fail addiction
- Coverage obsession
- Metrics tumour
- Sick testing techniques
